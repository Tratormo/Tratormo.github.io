Currently I am a PhD student at [ISTA](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/). I am very fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/).
My current research interests are
- High-Dimensional Non-Convex Optimization (neural networks trained with GD)
- High-Dimensional Inference (AMP algorithms)

Before joining ISTA I obtained a bachelors and masters in mathematics at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/).
During my master thesis I was supervised by Professor [Phan Th√†nh Nam](https://www.math.lmu.de/~nam/).


Outside of research I also enjoy
- cold training, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq6WHJzOkno) for some interesting science
- yoga and specifically meditation, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM) for an introduction to zen meditation
- reading (and writing) fantasy and watching anime
