Currently I am a PhD student at [ISTA](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/). I am very fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/).
My current research interests are
- High-Dimensional Non-Convex Optimization (neural networks trained with GD)
- High-Dimensional Inference (AMP algorithms)

Before joining ISTA I obtained a bachelors and masters in mathematics at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/).
During my master thesis I was supervised by Professor [Phan Th√†nh Nam](https://www.math.lmu.de/~nam/).


Outside of research I also enjoy
- researching and implementing protocols for physical and mental health:
  - cold training, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq6WHJzOkno) for some interesting science
  - yoga with a focus on meditation, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM) for an introduction to zen meditation and [here](https://www.amazon.com/Systematic-Course-Ancient-Tantric-Techniques/dp/8185787085) for a complete yoga system
  - red light, see [here](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/using-light-sunlight-blue-light-and-red-light-to-optimize-health) for an introductory discussion
  - extended water fasts, these [books](https://waterfasting.org/shop-online-course-videos-pdf/) are a good starting point
- reading and writing fantasy
- learning about the human psyche from psychotherapists
